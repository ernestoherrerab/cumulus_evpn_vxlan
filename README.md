#Cumulus EVPN VXLAN Topology

These playbooks are based on Dinesh Dutts vagrant topology
https://github.com/ddutt/evpn-in-the-datacenter

The playbooks are different for the network devices as they allow for additional cofigurations by just adding variables on the group vars file.
This is for a symmetrical-distributed routing approach.
